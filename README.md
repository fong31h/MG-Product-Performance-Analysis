# Sales_Pipeline_Analysis


In this project, I analyzed product performance through a variety of lenses for a Sales Pipeline using Excel.

The company MG asked its analysts to perform a product performance analysis to find which products were performing poorly and possible solutions.
Below are the results.

You can see the dashboard I created using Excel [here].

I also performed the same commands using SQL [here].

# Data Structure and Validation


# Executive Summary

In order to pinpoint which MG products were performing poorly and which were performing well, we first needed to decide on key metrics for evaluation.
We decided to use Close Percentage as well as total sales in combination because this allowed us to find which products had the greatest room for growth.

The first image displays the close percentage for each of the various products sold by MG. Based on our metrics of close percentage and total sales, the MG Advanced is the product
with the most room for growth. With a close percentage well below the average, as well as a high sales count, it's underperformance is highly impactful to revenue, unlike the GTK 500, which despite its low
close percentage, receives only a small fraction of the sales of the MG Advanced.

Now that we have identified the most important asset, we need to understand why the MG Advanced is underperforming. Unfortunately, we don't have access to things like customer satisfaction scores, so instead
we will look at surrounding factors to see if there is a correlation to the MG Advanced's underperformance.

The first factor we will look at is time.
